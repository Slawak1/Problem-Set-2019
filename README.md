#### Problem No.1 

    Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the 
    sum of all numbers between one and that number.

#### Solution:
    File Name: sumupto.py 
    To solve problem I used WHILE loop, But before that I decide to verify provided by 
    user number. I imported SYS module which allow me to use methode sys.exit() to 
    stop program when needed. In case that user provide string I used TRY and EXCEPT block
    to change 'Bad looking Error' to delivered by me. When error ocured in TRY block,
    EXCEPT block will be executed. In Next step I checked is provided number positive or
    negative Integer. I used IF ELSE Statement. If provided number lower than 0 program
    will stop and return a comment from ELSE block. 
    I declared two variables, i'll need them to store data.  
    While loop every time checks is variable 'sum' lower than provided by user number. 
    Every time variable 'sum' is incremented by 1. Also every time sum is added to
    sum_total.
    Program will end when condition sum < number is false.

#### Problem No.2 
    Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a day that begins with the letter T. 
    An example of running this program on a Thursday is as follows.

#### Solution:
    File Name: begins-with-t.py  
    I need to get current date. To do that I can use DATETIME library. String format function with
    %A directive as an argument will allow me to get today's weekday name. I save it to variable 
    'a_str'. Now I compare first item on the list with letter 'T'. To do that i can use IF ELSE 
    statement.

#### Problem No.3
    File name: divisors.py
    Write a program that prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 that are divisible by 6 
    but not 12.

#### Solution:
    To solve that task I can use FOR loop. FOR statement iterates over the members of a sequence in
     order, executing the block each time. In block is IF statement. Number is divided by 6 if
    remainder = 0 and number is not divided by 12 if remainder != 0. If this condition is TRUE
     number is printed, if FALSE nothing happen.

#### Problem No 4
    File name: collatz.py
    Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive
    values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the
    current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three 
    and add one. The program ends if the current value is one.

#### Solution:
    First I check is provided number positive integer (explained in Problem no. 1), To solve
    problem I used WHILE loop, with nested IF ELSE statement. Loop stops when
    number = 1. If number different than 1 IF ELSE statement is executed. IF statement checks
    is division remainder of number divided by 2 is equal 0. If TRUE number is divided and printed. 
    If NOT TRUE number is multiplied, added 1 and printed. WHILE loop checks condition again. 

#### Problem No 5
    File name: primes.py
    Write a program that asks the user to input a positive integer and tells the user whether 
    or not the number is a prime.

#### Solution: 
    First I checked is provided number positive integer (explained in Problem no. 1) Prime 
    number is a number which remainder of division is equal 0 only if divided by 1 and by 
    itself. It means that Prime number will give me only two results (where remainder of 
    division is = 0). Results of division are stored in list. If list length = 2 number 
    is prime. If list length is more that two, number is not prime. To check that I used IF ELSE statement. 
    (TO REMEMBER: The last integer generated by range() is up to, but not included ) This 
    is why I added Number + 1.

#### Problem No 6
    File name: secondstring.py
    Write a program that takes a user input string and outputs every second word.

#### Solution
    To solve that problem I need to get a provided by user string as a list. To do that I can
    use split() function, and use space ' ' as a separator. I need list length. 
    To print every second item from list I can use FOR loop with increment step = 2, in
    range from 0 to list length. 
    When list length was even I was getting an error "IndexError: list index out of range", to
    avoid that I Used TRY EXCEPT statement.

#### Problem No. 7
    File name: squareroot.py
    Write a program that takes a positive floating point number as input and outputs an
    approximation of its square root.

#### Solution
    First part of program valid of data input. If string input, returns an error message. 
    Statement IF checks is number negative. In math theory we can do square root of 
    negative number, if we take it as a complex number. A real number 'a' can be 
    regarded as a complex number 'a + 0j' whose imaginary part is 0. To work with complex 
    number I import module cmath. If negative number provided IF block will be executed 
    and result printed as imaginary part of complex number with 'j'. If positive 
    number provided ELSE block will be executed and result of rounding printed.

#### Problem No. 8
    File name: datetime1.py
    Write a program that outputs today’s date and time in the format ”Monday, January
    10th 2019 at 1:15pm”.

#### Solution
    To get current date and time I use 'datetime' library. With strftime() directives we can 
    set up date and time in a proper way. To get proper suffix, depends on the day of the month I use IF, ELIF and ELSE statements.

#### Problem No. 9
    File name: second.py
    Write a program that reads in a text file and outputs every second line. The program
    should take the filename from an argument on the command line.

#### Solution
    To get name of a file from command line I used sys.argv() function from sys library. 
    sys.argv() is a list of arguments separated by space " ", sys.arg[0] is a Python file name. 
    in this case sys.arg[1] is a string next after Python file name. 
    readlines() function allows me to save lines from file to list. 
    To print every second line I used FOR loop with step 2.

#### Problem No. 10
    Write a program that displays a plot of the functions x, x^2 and 2^x in the range [0, 4].

#### Solution
    
    To plot function I used matplotlib library with set of functions to setup chart as: title, label, xaxis, yaxis, legend and grid. To calculate functions I used Numpy library.
